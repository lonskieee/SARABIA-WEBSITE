                <p class="titlee">Vigan City in Ilocos Sur is one of the top cities and tourist spots in the Philippines where you can learn about the country’s rich culture and heritage in a very immersive way. In fact, the Historic City of Vigan was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999 and became one of the New7Wonders Cities in 2015. Our overall experience in Vigan was truly surreal. It brought us to a place seemingly frozen in time as if we were still in the Spanish colonial era.</p>

            <p>Calle Crisologo is Vigans most popular tourist attraction and is the highlight of a Vigan City tour. The grounds and pavements of this preserved street are made of cobblestones, and both sides are lined with ancestral houses that are reminiscent of old Spanish towns. During the daytime, the street is a busy commercial district, with most shops selling quality antiques, furniture, and jewelry pieces. You can indulge yourself in souvenir shopping, including native food products and delicacies, or snag world-class hand-woven clothing, blankets, and other accessories at Rowildas Weaving.</p>

            <p>​Also called the Saint Paul Metropolitan Cathedral, the Vigan Cathedral is another important landmark in Ilocos Surs capital city and is also included in a Vigan City tour. It stands in a prominent spot just in front of Plaza Salcedo, which is why you might find many tourists having their pictures taken between these notable structures. The cathedral pays homage to Baroque architecture as seen in the ornate details outside and inside the church, although the cathedral has had its share of renovations too to make it sturdier.</p>

            <p>OnNothing else can give you the best view of Vigan than the Bantay Church Bell Tower. The belfry is situated on a hill overlooking the Bantay district in northeast Vigan. You’ll need to climb a winding staircase to get to the top of the brick structure, where you’ll find an enormous bell hanging right in the middle of the tower. The watchtower served as a good vantage point for the natives of Ilocos to see approaching enemies during the Spanish reign and World War II.</p>

Take for example Pagburnayan Jar Factory, one of the very few remaining jar factories around Vigan. It’s a popular must-try cultural activity that is also part of a Vigan City tour.</p>

Here, you can take pictures, go people watching, or simply give your tired legs some resting time after a long walk around the area. If you’re feeling hungry, you can grab a quick bite of the best-selling empanada, a kind of pastry turnover filled with minced meat, vegetables, and egg, which is one of Ilocos’ specialty food products on this side of the town.</p>

            <p>Not too far from the center of Vigan City, you’ll find the Baluarte Resort and Mini Zoo sprawling on roughly 100 hectares of rolling plains and hills. The zoological park belongs to local politician Chavit Singson who used his property to share his love for safari to the public. Admission is free, and you can take snapshots with the more tamed animals like birds and ponies. Baluarte’s version of Jurassic Park includes make-believe life-size dinosaurs, which can be an amusing background for your photoshoots. There are a lot of activities in Baluarte Zoo you can try. Of course, it’s best if you stay clear of wild animals in the Baluarte like snakes, crocodiles, lions, and tigers, among others, and just settle for the daily shows featuring the animals that are kept in the zoo. Join a Baluarte Zoo tour that is usually a part of a Vigan tour. </p>

            <p>Some 15 minutes away from Vigan City is an ideal destination for tourists who are looking for a more active kind of fun. The Ilocos Sur Adventure Zone zip line traverses the towns of Santa and Bantay, so you have a perfect view of the picturesque Abra River down below as well as the old and new Quirino bridges. There’s a 5-story platform that you need to climb up before making your way to the zip line, which is about 400 meters long. The sports and recreation facility is open from sun up to sundown, and offers more adrenaline-pumping activities like a giant swing, kayaking, and rock climbing and rappelling at the rocky Banaoang mountains.</p>

            <p>Bigueños and Bigueñas also take pride in their town’s world-class natural heritage just like the Mindoro Beach that offers a front-facing view of the West Philippine Sea. This beach, which has black but smooth and fine sand, has some strong currents so if you’re planning to take a dip, do it with caution. Since Mindoro Beach is situated toward the west coast, it can be a good spot for watching sunsets.</p>

Plaza Salcedo features an outdoor light and water show that’s comparable to those you might see in other countries. As darkness falls, the fountain area at Plaza Salcedo gets jam-packed with tourists who come to witness a spectacular show of bright laser lights that illuminate the square. </p>

            <p>Ilocos Sur’s twin bridge, the Quirino Bridge and Banaoang Bridge, stand parallel to one another on a crossing along the grand Abra River. The older Quirino Bridge remains a tourist spot despite it being damaged by a typhoon in the early 2000s.A couple of years after its destruction, the bridge underwent reconstruction as a way of preserving its magnificent architectural design. Although the Quirino Bridge is not being used anymore, with the Banaoang Bridge replacing it, it’s still one of the country’s most beautiful bridges in anybody’s book. A view deck offers a stunning view of the picture-perfect twin bridge with theAbra mountains on the background. For a more dramatic effect, go for an aerial shot of the scenery using a drone.</p>
